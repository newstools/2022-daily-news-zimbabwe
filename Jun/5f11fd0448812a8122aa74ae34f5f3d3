THE Tobacco Industry Marketing Board (TIMB) lifted the suspension of Voedsel Tobacco and three other private tobacco contractors yesterday. This comes as last Friday TIMB had suspended eight companies over non-remittance of stop order deductions. But in a letter addressed to Voedsel managing director Innocent Mahufe yesterday, TIMB approved the contractor to resume its activities on the tobacco auction floor after they proved that they had made the remittances. “The purpose of this letter is to confirm that TIMB received proof of payments done for statutory obligations and we further request that you provide bank references for all the payments done before end of day today (yesterday). As a result, Voedsel Tobacco can resume its operations with immediate effect. The board will continue to monitor your sales points for compliance,” the letter reads. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, TIMB public relations officer Chelesani Moyo said all tobacco stakeholders should comply with the regulatory board to ensure the marketing season runs smoothly. “On the 3rd of June, 2022, TIMB suspended the operations of eight companies due to non-remittance of stop order deductions. The suspensions are lifted once the said companies comply. However, the Board will continue to monitor the operations of these companies for continued compliance. TIMB seeks to restore order and sanity to the tobacco industry,” she said. The other companies whose suspensions were lifted yesterday included Agritrade, Munakiri and Mbaluk
