The final track on the six-track is the song Shaka. Petronella ‘Lalla’ Matipa Lalla is optimistic that the album will reach a wider audience soon. The Zimbabwean added that she is currently working on videos for songs on the EP. The just-released EP is yet another amazing episode in the fairytale rise of the Bulawayo-born artiste, who was virtually unknown a few months ago.  Lalla was discovered on social media by Kalawa Jazmee Records producer DJ Jabs after she had featured on veteran producer Clive ‘Mono’ Mukundu’s Monolio Lockdown Jam session. DJ Jabs offered Lalla the chance to collaborate with the internationally-acclaimed Kenzo. The Zimbabwe College of Music national certificate holder said what also made DJ Jabs’ offer hard to believe was that it came at a time many local music stars had refused to collaborate with her. Petronella ‘Lalla’ Matipa “When he called at the end of last year I had tried in vain to collaborate with many local stars who sadly didn’t believe I was good enough for them. In fact, when I performed with my band on Mono’s Lockdown Jam session it was simply for the love of music.  “We were not looking to impress anyone; we were just doing it for fun,” she said.
