He said the grand total at all operational dams stands at 55,95 percent, with 232 003 700 cubic metres out of which 215 418 592 cubic metres is usable. The town clerk added that significant gains were realised from January 4, with 22,4 percent being the total gained from all six supply dams.

The total cumulative inflows received from January 4 stand at 92 890 988.37 cubic metres. Meanwhile, five dams in Matabeleland are full, with three others having started spilling, according to the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) Zinwa had, therefore, urged people living in downstream communities to be on high alert and to avoid crossing at unsafe points which puts them in danger of being swept away. Zinwa said national storage levels had risen to 82,6 percent, significantly higher than 63,7 percent normally expected at this time of the year. The Meteorological Services Department has also warned that once dams reach 100 percent, and start spilling, they pose downstream flood risks. by  Andile Tshuma in BULAWAYO
