ONE Commando Regiment soldier Kudakwashe Kaminza is in soup for allegedly shooting a Harare man to death and robbing him of US$2 800. The 21-year–old man was advised to apply for bail at the High Court when he appeared before Harare magistrate Yeukai Dzuda on Friday. According to the State, on October 21 last year at around 0300 hours, Kaminza, allegedly worked in cahoots with four accomplices who are still at large and hatched a plan to rob the deceased and pounced at his Harare home. The deceased and his wife were asleep in their bedroom when they were awakened by heavy knocking by the gang which claimed they were police officers.  Unconvinced, the deceased reportedly opened his bedroom window screaming to attract the attention of neighbours. The armed robbers allegedly then climbed on the bonnet of a pickup motor vehicle which was parked close to the bedroom window and  produced an AK47 rifle and started shooting towards the bedroom window. Prosecutor Fungai N`angu told the court that Kaminza went on to break the window burglar bar and gained entry into the bedroom and started assaulting the deceased and his wife. He allegedly threatened them with death if they failed to give them money. The wife then surrendered US$2 800, $$10 900  and Itel P36 Pro to Kaminza.  Kaminza and his accomplices then exited through the window and when the now deceased opened the door in an effort to follow the armed robbers, Kaminza shot him several times. He died on the spot, while Kaminza and his accomplices fled from the scene. On January 12, the Criminal Investigation Department traced the deceased person’s cellphone   and the deceased’s wife positively identified it, leading to the arrest of Kaminza. He led to the recovery of the AK47 rifle from One Commando Regiment. by Shamaine Chirimujiri
