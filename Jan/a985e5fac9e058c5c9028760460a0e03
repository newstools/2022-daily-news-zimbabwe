MUSIC star Mambo Dhuterere’s collaboration with Tswana await artiste Zolasko has set new YouTube records in Botswana. The song Hameni Hlebanna — sung in both Shona and Tswana-reached the two million  views mark on YouTube within three months of release, and the elated Tswana musician has attributed the milestone to the great influence of Mambo Dhuterere. “Thank you Zimbabwe for your support and love… You really value and respect my artwork. I wish Botswana to do the same in 2022.  The song just reached two million views in three months on YouTube and it’s history in Botswana, no one has ever reached two million views in three months on YouTube here in Botswana…,” Zolasko Vatsay said. Garnering two million views on YouTube in Botswana within such a short space of time is a milestone given the fact that Botswana has a small population of less than 2.5million. Here in Zimbabwe, Hameni Hlebanna’s video was recently voted number three on ZTV’s end of year Top 50. The musicians — Mambo Dhuterere and Zolasko — collaborated on the commercially successful project as part of their strategy to spread wings across the region. Zolasko made a name for himself after featuring on hit Dololo by Vee Mampeezy. Mambo Dhuterere, on the other hand, is making inroads here in Zimbabwe and Botswana.  “Most people in Botswana used to know me as a businessman not a musician. I first moved to Botswana when I was just 17 and that was when I learned their culture including the language. As a result, it was very easy for me to click with Zolasko,” he said. The Mweya Ndisesekedze hit maker revealed he was happy to feature on a fast-paced Kwaito beat. “Kwaito music is too fast compared to my musical beat which is rather slow.  Featuring on the song was a learning experience for me as I tried hard to slow the kwaito beat and I am happy with the outcome,” said Mambo Dhuterere.
