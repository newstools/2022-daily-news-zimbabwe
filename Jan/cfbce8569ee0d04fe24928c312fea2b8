THE police are investigating a case of poaching that happened at Eldorado Game Park in Macheke, Mashonaland East, on Friday. Three suspected poachers were arrested whilst one escaped after shooting three impalas and one bushbuck. Mashonaland East provincial police spokesperson Simon Chazovachii confirmed the incident to the Daily News on Sunday yesterday. “Four suspected poachers sneaked into Eldorado Game Park on Thursday night with the intention of poaching. They were armed with rifles accessorised with microscopic telescopes. “The game park guards heard the first shot which killed an impala and started hunting the poachers down.  By the time they caught up with them they had already killed two more impalas and one bushbuck. “The four exchanged fire with the guards whilst trying to get away in their vehicle, but the driver lost control and fell in a ditch. One fled the scene with his rifle whilst three surrendered to the challenging guards. The police recovered the carcasses and the vehicle whilst the three suspects were taken into custody. Further investigations are still underway,” Chazovachii said. The incident happened barely two weeks after another poacher shot a Lichtenstein Hartebeest on the same game park. The guards heard the shot and went to investigate before the poacher escaped through the game fence, leaving the wounded animal behind. “There are over 14 armed guards at the game park and it is not easy to get away with poaching. In this incident the managers did an amazing job, they were brave, challenged the poachers, exchanged fire and overwhelmed the poachers. “The police were also quick to attend the incident and arrested the suspects,” an informed source told the Daily News on Sunday. by Rumbidzai Ngwenya
