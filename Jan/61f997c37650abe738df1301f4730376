POPULAR socialite and fashionista Danielle Simba Allen and her affluent Nigerian husband Ego held a lobola celebration party in Harare over the weekend in one of the biggest celebrity events in recent years. The glitz and glam “green wedding,” held at The Nest at Thirty along Domboshava Road, was graced by internationally acclaimed  Nigerian music star Davido as well as Pokello, Jackie Ngarande  and Affirmative Action Group Zimbabwe (AAG) president Mike Chimombe,  to name just but a few. The T.I.R Fashion House director’s colourful lobola celebration party came on the back of the celebrity couple’s engagement that occurred in August last year in Las Vegas, USA. On Saturday, Davido who is a friend to the groom — a business tycoon and socialite — took to the dance floor, and in typical Nigerian style, threw wads of cash into the air. By flooding the floor with the most sought-after United States dollars, Davido and some of the “Big Boys” team sent the social media into a frenzy.  In Nigeria, the money dance is a cultural tradition at many wedding receptions where guests offer the newlyweds money to dance with them, or they shower the couple with money. The custom is to help establish the couple in their new life together, or to show how much they are loved and appreciated. Simply known as Dani, the Zimbabwean fashionista is a high flyer with business interests in Zimbabwe, Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Before settling down, Dani was known for dating men of means such as Musa Danjuma — a prominent Nigerian businessman and the executive Chairperson of Nigeria America Line Limited and Comet Shipping Agencies Nigeria Limited. Locally, Dani is known to be friends with some of the rich and famous such as Tazvi Mhaka, the late Genius “Ginimbi” Kadungure and Luminitsa Dumbisa Jemwa, among others.
