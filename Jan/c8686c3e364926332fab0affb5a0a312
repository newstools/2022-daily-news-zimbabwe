FOLLOWING Thursday night Eldorado Game Park, Macheke, poaching where three poachers were arrested after shooting four animals, police have confirmed that one of the suspects is an operations director of a Harare security company. Mashonaland East provincial police spokesperson Simon Chazovachii told the Daily News yesterday their investigations had shown that the security firm director James Munhupedzi (48) of Mabelreign in Harare, teamed up with three other suspects identified as Simbarashe Tumba (22) of village 15 Masomera Marondera, Tineyi Chari (40) of Ngaura Village, Dema, and Live Makamuna and drove to Machekeke where they targeted Eldorado Game Park. “The ZRP is looking for information that may lead to the arrest of Live Makamuna and we are saying poaching is a very serious offence. “We are also saying people must not abuse firearms that are meant for provision of security or they should not breach conditions under which those firearms are acquired,” Chazovachii said.  Armed with service rifles which were accessorised with microscopic telescopes, the four sneaked into the park, shot and killed the first impala before hunting down other animals. Fortunately the Eldorado guards were on high alert, heard the first shot and also started hunting down the perpetrators.  By the time they caught up with them Munhupedzi and company had already killed three impalas and a bushbuck. The four tried to get away in their vehicle whilst exchanging fire with the Eldorado Game Park security guards.  The driver lost control and the vehicle fell in a ditch before they were overwhelmed by the guards. Munhupedzi, Tumba and Chari were arrested whilst Makamuna managed to escape in the night. The poaching incident follows after there has also been a surge of security personnel using service rifles to commit horrendous crimes such as armed robberies and murder.
