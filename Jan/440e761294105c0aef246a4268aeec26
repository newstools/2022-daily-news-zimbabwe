BUSINESSMAN and Zimbabwe Amalgamated Churches Council (Zacc) patron Jimayi Muduvuri  has warned former Zanu PF members against  interfering  with the ruling party’s internal issues  as they are allegedly bent on dividing the leadership. Muduvuri told the Daily News yesterday that any Zanu PF member with complaints against the former liberation movement must direct them to the relevant party structures. “We are worried that our party leaders are being degraded by some former Zanu PF members. They want to tell party leadership what to do, forgetting that they are no longer members of the party. If they want to re-join the party, they must use proper channels,” Muduvuri said. Muduvuri particularly singled out former Zanu PF chairperson for Mashonaland West Province, Temba Mliswa, who is now independent Norton MP, accusing him of being at the forefront of the alleged interference.   “Mliswa is my relative, but I think he is now destroying Zanu PF because he is blasting ruling party leaders in public and this must stop. The party has an open door policy so those who are not happy must approach relevant offices,” he said, adding that it was important for the ruling party to remain united ahead of by-elections in March and the 2023 national elections. “People must stop unnecessary fights. We must work harder so that the party and President Emmerson Mnangagwa win elections. The ruling party must bury the opposition in 2023 and we can only do this if the party is united. “We accept diversity and thus, call upon those who are refusing to accept reality to swallow their pride and accept that … Mnangagwa is the legitimate leader,” he added.
