VETERAN songtress Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave is set to share the stage with multi-platinum-selling South African gospel artiste Dr Tumi in Birmingham, United Kingdom on March 5. Fungisai’s forthcoming concert with Dr Tumi, who is also a practicing medical doctor, will be her first in the UK since 2017 when she performed at the Summer Festival alongside the late Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi, Jah Prayzah and Winky D among others. Dubbed “Gratitude Tour”, the UK gig is being organised by Rainbow Entertainment. The Toita Zvedenga singer told the Daily News that the tour will provide a perfect platform for her to promote her duet with South African gospel star Winnie Mashaba.  “By then, I would have released my single Mufaro Wangu which I did with Mashaba. I am so excited to be part of this concert,” Fungisai said. Mashaba, nicknamed the doctor of sacred music, is a multi-award-winning South African gospel musician and television presenter with a 22-year singing career that has spawned 15 albums. Fungisai’s show comes at a time when many local musicians are looking forward to performing in foreign countries where Covid-19 restrictions have been relaxed. “I cannot wait to reunite and interact with my fans in the UK. Remember, we were all grounded due to Covid-19,” she said. The gospel songstress added that she was also looking forward to sharing the stage with Dr Tumi, born Tumisang Makweya, who is best known for his hit albums such as The Gathering of Worshippers and Love on the Cross, among others. Fungisai has close to 20 years’ experience on the music scene. Her chart-top charting albums include Zvirevo, Highway, Toita Zvedenga, Chandisimudza and Healing Devotion, among others.
