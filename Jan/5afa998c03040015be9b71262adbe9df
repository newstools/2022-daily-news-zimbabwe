THE Zimbabwe Republic Police has partnered with police forces from neighbouring Zambia, Botswana and Namibia on a joint operation to flush out illegal activities such as smuggling along the Zambezi and Chobe rivers. While Zimbabwe does not share a land border with Namibia, the Caprivi Strip which links the two countries has been used as a smuggling corridor for fuel and contraband such as cigarettes and illegal substances by smugglers.  In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said the four nations would leave no stone unturned in their endeavour to plug criminal activities on the porous borders. “An interstate joint patrol team including police details from Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia held a joint river patrol along the Zambezi and Chobe rivers in Victoria Falls.  “The purpose of the patrol was to combat cross border crimes such as smuggling of fuel, and liquor products in the four countries,” Nyathi said. The joint operation commenced on Friday. Joint operations have previously helped in curbing criminal cross border activities at the country’s borders. A similar operation was carried out along the Limpopo River during the festive season where police were targeting criminal activities taking place between Zimbabwe and South Africa. Meanwhile, the police are seeking information that could lead to the arrest of unknown assailants who shot at and killed a 63-year-old Binga man at Ngotola Village in Semwa, Siabuwa, Binga, on Thursday last week. The deceased has been identified as Wireless Siamalongo Munsaka.
