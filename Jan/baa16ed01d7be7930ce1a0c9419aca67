SONS of the late music legend Zexie Manatsa, who died last week in Harare after losing his battle with cancer, have honoured him by cutting off their dreadlocks. According to Tendai Manatsa, one of Chipo Chiroorwa singer’s sons, cutting off the locks will help the family to heal quickly. “It’s a gesture of respect and honour for our father. We have lost our hero and we felt this is how we can show our honour.  “ It is a really tough time for me and the whole family at large. We hope this helps us heal,” Tendai said.   Another son, Aaron concurred with Tendai. “He was a perfect father who left us nothing but too many beautiful memories and blessings. Though our hearts are shattered, we have hope.  “I have decided to cut my hair for the first time since 2007 as a gesture of love and loss, I honour and miss him,” he said. Manatsa succumbed to Multiple Myeloma — a type of cancer of the blood — last week at Parirenyatwa hospital in Harare at the age of 78. He was buried at Warren Hills cemetery in the capital on Sunday, leaving behind wife Stella, six children and 14 grandchildren. Acting President Constantino Chiwenga described him as a true hero. “Zex remains an iconic figure in the music industry whose music career dates back to the colonial days and peaking at the height of our armed liberation struggle.  “He contributed immensely to the struggle for our country’s Independence through satirical, poetic compositions.  “Songs such as Baba Tipeiwo Ndege, Musango Mune Hangaiwa, Ndarota Ndina Mai, among others immediately come to mind,” Chiwenga said in a statement released yesterday. “The name Zex Manatsa occupies pride of space in the annals of our national music industry and will always be remembered for the generosity of his heart as well as the mentorship and support of aspiring young musicians, including many successful top Zimbabwean musicians we have today,” Chiwenga said.
