BULAWAYO residents in some of the city’s suburbs will go for at least four days without the precious liquid from tomorrow as the local authority carries out maintenance works on one of its reservoirs. In a statement issued yesterday, Bulawayo town clerk Christopher Dube advised residents that all areas serviced by the Thuli reservoir should expect water supply interruption from Sunday afternoon. He said taps would run dry from January 9 to January 12. Outside Bulawayo, Imbizo barracks and Esigodini, which are supplied by Thuli, will also be affected. The Thuli reservoir was built in 1995 and has been servicing the city ever since. “The City of Bulawayo would like to advise members of the public that there would be interruption of water supplies to areas fed by Thuli reservoir from Sunday, 9 January 2022 at 1500 hours  to Wednesday 12 January 2022 at 1500 hours. This interruption will allow for the inspection of cracks and soundness of the Clear Water Reservoir at Ncema (built in 1955) that feeds into the Thuli reservoir,” said the Town Clerk. The affected areas would be  Esigodini, Imbizo Barracks, Fortunes Gate, Selbourne Park,  Matsheumhlophe, Parklands, Khumalo, Queenspark, Suburbs, Mahatshula, Woodville, Kingsdale, Lockview, Sunninghill, Marlands, Glencore, Riverside waterford, Manningdale, Willsgrove, Buenavista and  Douglasdale.  The town clerk said normal service would be restored once the maintenance works were complete and pumping resumed.  “Bulawayo City Council wishes to apologise to its valued customers for the inconvenience likely to be caused and assures the affected residents that supplies will be restored once the treatment and subsequent pumping resumes at Ncema Water works,” said Dube. by  Andile Tshuma In BULAWAYO
