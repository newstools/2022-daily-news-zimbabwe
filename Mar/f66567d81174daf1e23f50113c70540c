Hazel Marimbiza POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested an alleged serial rapist who has so far reportedly violated more than a dozen of teenage girls in the city. At the time of his arrest, Prosper Bhule, 27, is suspected to have raped 16 teenage girls. In an interview with the Daily News yesterday acting Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson, Nomalanga Msebele confirmed the arrest.   “I can confirm that we have arrested a suspect in connection with the 16 rapes that occurred in Bulawayo. However police are still conducting further investigations so you will get more details in due course,” said Msebele. According to police, the suspected rapist’s modus operandi would be to ask mostly high school female pupils to accompany him to collect groceries purportedly sent from the diaspora by their relatives before raping them. On Thursday Bulawayo police spokesperson Abednico Ncube told the Daily News had launched a manhunt for Bhule who was reportedly operating in Pumula Old, Luveve, Cowdray Park, Gwabalanda, Entumbane and Njube suburbs. “This suspect goes around visiting lone juveniles claiming to have been sent by their relatives who are in diaspora. He tells them that he is having some groceries which they have to collect. “He can even offer to pay for the transport for the unsuspecting victims. He takes them to Gwabalanda areas then leads them into a bushy area where he rapes them. He has committed these crimes for the past two weeks and the latest is Tuesday,” said Ncube. Ncube appealed to members of the public particularly those in diaspora to contact their relatives at home and update them when they send goods or money.  “Those that are at home including children should not entertain strangers. Always call the people who will have claimed to have sent the groceries to verify and avoid leaving your homes to visit unknown places in the name of receiving groceries”.
