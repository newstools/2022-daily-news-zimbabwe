POPULAR Citizens Coalition for Change supporter Godfrey Karembera, popularly known as Madzibaba Veshanduko, has been granted $10 000 bail. Karembera was arrested for allegedly undermining the police, but he claimed he was beaten by the police for allegedly wearing a yellow robe and chanting slogans in town.  It is alleged he was told to stop chanting slogans, but he declined and went on to insult the police officers, resulting in his arrest. Represented by Doug Coltart, Karembera made three applications, two of which were dismissed by the court.  He sought an immediate release arguing that his client was over detained and appeared before a court after the prescribed 48 hours and that he was severely beaten by the police while in custody. Coltart also challenged Karembera’s placement on remand saying the facts as alleged by the police did not constitute an offence. He also applied for his admission to bail, an application which found favour with the court. The State had opposed the granting of bail, saying there was likelihood he was to commit similar offences as there are elections coming. Harare magistrate Barbra Mateko ordered Karembera to report twice a week at Guruve police station until the matter is finalised. It is alleged that on March 17, police officers were on patrol at the intersection of Julius Nyerere Way and Nelson Mandela Avenue, Harare, when they met Karembera, who was dressed in a yellow robe and chanting slogans attracting a crowd to the annoyance of other people who alerted the police. The police officers approached him and advised him to stop what he was doing, but he did not take heed of their warning and started shouting at them, accusing them of being used, it is alleged. The cops reportedly told him that he was under arrest and he turned violent, resisting arrest, but the cops ganged up and subdued him and took him to Harare Central Police Station.
