Dionne Kanyowakanyowa@dailynews.co.zw SURETIES of a local company, Select Healthcare, stand to lose their property  after failing  to pay back an NMB bank  loan to the tune of $3.6 million after  agreeing to a settlement plan. Justice Samuel Deme ordered Tafadzwa P and Biggie Magarira to pay back the loan and also ordered for their Pomona-based property to be attached and sold for the recovery of the bank’s money as well as legal costs in a default judgment. “Defendants jointly and severally one paying the other to be absolved shall pay to plaintiff, the sum of $3 647 380.41 which is the capital debt and interests accrued on the loan facility which the 1st defendant took from the plaintiff in September 2020. “An order that property Number 361 Pomona Township,  Harare,  measuring  2 818 square meters  in the name  of Biggie Magarira  and Tafadzwa Perpetua  Magarira  be declared executable and must be sold by the plaintiff by private treaty to recover  its dues, including legal costs,” ruled  Deme.Sometime in September 2020 Biggie and Tafadzwa registered themselves as the guarantors and the sureties for a $3 million loan that was taken in the name of Select Healthcare from the bank. They also put down their Pomona property as collateral security.  The terms of the loan as agreed by the parties were that the balance outstanding under the loan was to never exceed $3 million.Furthermore, interest that remained unpaid on the due date would be added to the capital amount and would also earn a further interest as if it was part of the capital amount of the loan. However, Biggie and Tafadzwa failed to pay the loan as it fell due   even after having agreed to settle the loan payment outside court through a payment plan. This then led the bank to serve the pair with summons the following year in September demanding to be paid their loan with interests back as well as the attachment of the property that had been put down as security by the duo. The pair failed to respond to the summons within the stipulated time, thereby prompting the bank to apply for a default judgment, which was granted.
