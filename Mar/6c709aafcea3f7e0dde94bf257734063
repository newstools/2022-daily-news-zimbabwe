Tamary Chikiwa MIDLANDS has a number of idle water ponds which if utilised can serve as sources of irrigation for boosting the province’s agriculture, an official has said. Addressing delegates at a two-day Great Dyke Mining and Agriculture Investment Conference in Gweru yesterday, Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines vice president Thomas Gono singled out ponds in Zvishavane which he said could be used for irrigation purposes. “Midlands Province, besides being rich in minerals and housing the great dyke has high potential in agriculture as it has idle ponds. For instance there are ponds in Zvishavane around Mimosa along Bulawayo Road, these are huge and can be actively used for irrigation purposes,” Gono said.   He called on Midlanders not to just focus on mining only but consider investing in agriculture. “The water which is available all year round can also be used for agricultural purposes including fish farming, ranching and irrigation potentially producing a greenbelt in terms of agriculture”. Additionally, Tonderai Kapesa, a member of the Africa Economic Development Strategies (AEDS), said there was particular scope for investment in animal husbandry and dairy sectors in the province. “There is potential in the establishment of more dairies in the central parts of the province where the soil is suitable. “There are several heritage sites across the province which can be converted into tourism hubs for both domestic and international visitors”. The annual conference brought together farmers and miners in the great dyke as the AEDS presented an in-depth report of business opportunities in the mining and agriculture sectors for the betterment of the province.
