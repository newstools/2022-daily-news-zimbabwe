BULAWAYO Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso  is backing his charges to end a four-game winless streak when they face Harare City in a Castle Lager Premiership match tomorrow at Barbourfields Stadium. The Twitter Kings, who are undergoing a massive re-building exercise are without a victory in their last four matches in which they picked up two defeats and two draws. However, Terroso is encouraged by last weekend’s goalless draw against ZPC Kariba, which he said had a lot of positives. “In terms of what we are doing and how things are going, it has been positive. Players are trying to improve on certain areas that we have identified and we continue with the same cycle that we normally have every week,” Terroso said.   “There are areas that I have identified as a coach that we need to improve and we are working on them. I honestly feel like the Kariba game was our best performance. We were able to put all things together something we haven’t been able to do in our previous games. “We were able to manage the game with more intelligence, with a little bit more maturity which is something important to the team. There is only one way to turn things around and that is through hard work and dedication. “We are doing and continue to believe in everything that we are working on, which is our style of play, both on and off the pitch. We are not going to lose focus in terms of our objective which is to win. “We kept a clean sheet in Kariba, which is very good, the points, of course, are a concern no one is happy when you lose but we have to know how to manage those sorts of situations and disappointments.” Terroso continued: “The team has been showing positivity since January. We need to continue that and perform even better. On Sunday we are hoping we will get all three points. I am happy with the squad, the team that we are building is changing, and they are huge improvements on and off the pitch.”
