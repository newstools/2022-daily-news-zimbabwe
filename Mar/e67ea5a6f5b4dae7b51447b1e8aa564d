CITIZENS Coalition for Change (CCC) activist Godfrey Karembera has been charged with undermining the police. Karembera, also known as Madzibaba Veshanduko, claims he was beaten by the police when he was arrested for allegedly wearing a yellow robe and chanting slogans in town.  It is alleged he was ordered to stop chanting slogans, but he declined and went on to insult the police officers resulting in his arrest. On Saturday, a Harare magistrate remanded him on his hospital bed where he was receiving treatment following injuries sustained from the alleged beatings.  A hearing on his freedom will be conducted today with indications that his lawyers want to challenge the legality of his detention. It is alleged that on March 17 police officers were on patrol at the intersection of Julius Nyerere Way and Nelson Mandela Avenue, Harare, when they met Karembera who was dressed in a yellow robe and chanting slogans, attracting a crowd to the annoyance of other people who alerted the police. The police officers approached him and advised him to stop what he was doing, but he allegedly did not take heed and started shouting at them, accusing them of being used. The cops reportedly told him that he was under arrest and he allegedly turned violent, resisting arrest until the cops ganged up, subdued and took him to Harare Central Police Station.
