AN inmate reportedly fled at Chikurubi farm on the guise that he was going to relieve himself in the bush before fleeing and only to be caught in Banket. Casias Jack, 25, who has since been taken back to prison was charged with escaping from lawful custody when he appeared before Harare magistrate Judith Taruvinga. It is alleged that on December 24 last year, Jack was escorted to the Chikurubi prison farm to work together with other inmates under guard. At around 9am, he allegedly requested to go to the toilet and he was told to use the bush to relieve himself.   After a moment, the prison officer called for him but there was no response. The prison officer reportedly saw Jack outside the prison farm fence and called for help from other prison guards. They reportedly gave chase but could not catch him and even checked on the address he gave but he could not be found. A report was made to the police who launched a manhunt and he was located and caught in Banket. In another matter, another inmate Richard Sasumba who was serving a sentence for armed robbery escaped from Harare Central Prison in October last year only to be caught this month in Epworth. Sasumba was convicted of armed robbery in Bindura and committed to serve at Harare Central Prison. While serving his sentence, on October 7 he escaped from lawful custody and a search was made but he could not be found. The court heard that on March 9 this year, prisons got information that Sasumba was seen in Epworth and made a follow up and apprehended him at a house there and took him back to prison.
