Shamaine Chirimujiri chirimujiris@dailynews.co.zw PARITY Real Estate company appeared in court yesterday on allegations of duping a home seeker of US$120 000 after it allegedly misrepresented to Dumisani Mbulawa that the firm was selling a house. The company was represented by its chief executive officer, Charity Vambe, who was remanded out of custody to May 4 by Harare magistrate Yeukai Dzuda.  She was not asked to plead to charges of fraud. Circumstances are that sometime early last year, the company advertised a house for sale in Marlborough Township, Harare, measuring 5 057 square metres on Zim Classifieds website. Prosecutor Lynette Gwarisa told the court when Mbulawa saw the advertisement he reportedly got interested in the house and approached Mugiya and Muvhami Law Chambers for verification and conveyance processes. The law chambers allegedly advised the complainant to proceed with payments after they had verified the process. It is claimed that Mbulawa made a total payment of US$120 000 to Parity Real Estate for the purchase of the house. Upon completion of payment, the court heard, the complainant discovered that the house belonged to Minod Zinyama and was not on sale. Mbulawa was allegedly prejudiced of US$120 000 although US$20 000 has since been recovered.
