UNITED States-based Chimurenga music icon Thomas “Mukanya” Mapfumo is set to return to South Africa in May. The veteran musician’s forthcoming tour follows his performance in that country late last year backed by South Africa-based Nox.   On May 28, the music legend is scheduled to share the stage with local artists who include Kurai Makore, Judgement Yard and Irie Dread at the Newtown Music Factory in Johannesburg.  The presence of Makore on the bill has excited some Chimurenga music fans. Makore, who released his debut album called Gara Unzwe has been described as Mukanya incarnate.   Interestingly, two years ago Mukanya endorsed his nephew Makore during a virtual concert dubbed “Celebrating the Life of a Legend.” “I have allowed him to do what he is doing (perform Mapfumo’s song). He is doing it for me, his father (uncle). Please help him in his project and I thank you all for your support. Work with him such that his musical project will be a success,” Mapfumo said in a promotional video that went viral on social media then. The pending South Africa concert comes four years after the outspoken artiste’s unsuccessful Zimbabwe Peace Tour which was bungled by his promoter. Despite the fact that age is fast catching up with him, Mukanya recently told the Daily News that he was not contemplating retiring from holding musical performances. “Music is not a profession but it runs in my blood. I was born an artiste hence there is no way I can retire from being myself. I will die a musician,” the 76-year old veteran musician said. Mapfumo ventured into music as a 16-year-old, when he joined Zutu Brothers (Cyclones). Since 2003, Mapfumo has lived in Oregon in the United States of America.
