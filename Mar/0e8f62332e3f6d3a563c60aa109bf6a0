A BINDURA thief was sentenced to 10 years in jail for committing 19 counts of unlawful entry and theft in and around the town since last year. Peter Kazhanje (38) appeared before Bindura Magistrate Court on Friday. “Kazhanje committed theft in and around Bindura from July 2021 to March 2022, where property which include 5×32 inch television sets, a 42 inch television set, four laptops and 14 cellphones were recovered,” police said in a tweet yesterday. In another case, the police have arrested a man for possession of 45 metres of TelOne copper cables in Madziwa.   Simbarashe Tomu was brought to the police on Saturday by a motorist who spotted him rolling the cables near Mupfurudzi Tollgate. Meanwhile the police have warned motorists against offering transport to strangers following a robbery that occurred in Harare over the weekend.  A Norton man was robbed of his car, money and phone after offering transport to two men who pretended to be going to Norton. “At about 9 pm, a Norton man (36) lost a Toyota Runx vehicle, US $80, $700 and an Itel phone to robbers, after he offered a lift to two unknown suspects at Whitehouse bus stop on the pretext that they were going to Kasa Banana Compound in Norton. “On reaching the intended bus stop the suspects attacked the motorist and stole his valuables,” the police said. The police have since launched an investigation into the matter.  By  Rumbidzai Ngwenya
