THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) on Thursday pledged to increase vigilance at ports of entry to ensure that the country does not serve as a transit point or destination of smuggled goods. This was said by Zimra acting commissioner-general Regina Chinamasa at a “#I’mForZero” breakfast meeting with stakeholders in the border city of Mutare. She said: “Given our strategic location in the region, as Zimra it is our pledge not to allow Zimbabwe to be the final destination or transit of smuggled goods.” “Constant vigil and intervention by all of us is therefore critical to build our nation, Zimbabwe and by extension, the region. Let’s all overcome corruption and work towards a corruption-free society,” she said.   Chinamasa said Zimra required assistance to tackle corruption which was fuelling the irregular importation, exportation, and transit of goods. “Corruption is one of the biggest non-tariff barriers that make our products less competitive on the international market and erodes investor confidence,” she said. “Exchange of information combats corruption and also helps increase compliance levels. Corruption breeds and sustains underdevelopment if left unchecked and we need to put an end to all such vices. Eradicating corruption is, therefore, a collective feat given its retrogressive impact on the economy and region.” Chinamasa said in line with national and international commitments, Zimra would intensify the fight against corruption at all levels. “Our economy is heavily dependent on sustainable domestic revenue mobilisation for social and infrastructural development. Corruption and tax evasion threaten our economy and the quality of our lives and this is why today’s engagement is so important. Put bluntly, corruption is stealing from the poor for they bear the impact of the scourge through underdevelopment,” she said.
