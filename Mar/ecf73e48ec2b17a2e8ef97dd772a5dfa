According to the police, Nkayi villagers wanted to transport fertiliser from Bulawayo to their villages, but they did not have any transport.The police said the villagers then told Mlotshwa their predicament and he assured them he would be able to help them transport the fertiliser if they were willing to pay.  “The suspect allegedly collected some money from several villagers in the community as payment for transporting 300 bags fertiliser to the ward yet the GMB truck which was used was not supposed to be considered for any transport fee,” said Nyathi.Some villagers later found out that they were not supposed to pay any amount for transporting the fertilisers, leading them to report Mlotshwa to the police.Meanwhile, the police in Gwanda have arrested three men for allegedly stealing two goats at Bronson mine, Colleen Bawn.  Message Muponda, 25, Ephias Mano, 28 and Siza Nkosi were arrested by the police after being found in possession of two goat carcasses.“The trio were intercepted at a roadblock site along Bulawayo-Beitbridge in a Toyota Sienta vehicle AFO 9205 after police officers noticed two goat carcasses which were stashed in a bucket,” said the police.
