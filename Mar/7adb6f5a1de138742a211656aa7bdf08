QUADRIPLEGICS and Paraplegics Association of Zimbabwe (QPAZ) in partnership with Leonard Chishire have ranked Shurugwi as Midlands Province’s number one local authority in adopting disability inclusion policies. The organisations are working with local authorities in Kwekwe, Shurugwi, Zvishavane and Silobela to set up ward development committees to allow them to include people with disabilities in all their decision making bodies. Speaking during a disability meeting meant to give an update of the local authorities’ response to the call in Kwekwe at the weekend, QPAZ director Audrey Rusike said Shurugwi has shown a more positive response in disability inclusion policy implementation than other local authorities.“So far there is a positive response in the province with Shurugwi council topping them as the local authority has already reached a consensus to say 15 percent of stands allocated by council are to be issued to people with disabilities,” Rusike said. Rusike said the local authority had also gone further to exempt people living with disabilities from paying rates.“This gesture shows how the Shurugwi council is adopting the disability inclusion policy which the government is advocating for,” she said, calling on all councils in the province to take a leaf from Shurugwi and allow inclusive policies that are disability friendly.  Speaking at the same meeting, QPAZ communications officer Nozipho Rutsate reiterated that there was a need for every structure in the society to include people with disabilities in line with the national disability policy. “We are working with local authorities, victim friendly units, schools and other stakeholders so that every societal structure includes people with disabilities,” she said. This comes as President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched the country’s national disability policy in June last year.The policy which was developed with support from various stakeholders including the United Nations seeks to address the marginalisation and discrimination of persons with disabilities, empower them to improve their own quality of life and enable them to contribute towards the national development agenda. It sets standards for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all facets of life, thereby serving as an overarching policy framework on disability across all sectors, including the public, private and development sectors.
