Hazel Marimbiza THE government says it has made strides in its bid to end energy poverty in rural areas as the electrification programme continues to expand with over 9 790 rural institutions electrified since last year. Speaking during a webinar organised by the ministry of Women Affairs yesterday, under the topic ‘‘Charting a gender responsive Zimbabwean pathway in the face of climate change,’’ Energy ministry permanent secretary Gloria Magombo said the government had a special fund set aside to accelerate rural electrification. “We want to address the issue of energy poverty within our rural communities because all rural communities need to have access to modern energy. Basically what that means is the ability to have at least an electric light whether it’s from solar or from direct current electricity from the grid.  “As a ministry, we have legal instruments in the name of the rural electrification fund which was created as a response by the government to accelerate electrification of rural institutions. As we speak right now, as of December 31 2021, we have over 9 790 rural institutions  which have since been electrified but we still have more work to do,” Magombo said. She further noted that the ministry had a clear plan which shows that 68 percent of the country’s rural communities need to have electricity access . “We can electrify those using grid extensions whilst 32 percent of the rural areas have to use off grid systems,” she said adding that electrification of rural areas would come with a lot of benefits particularly for women. “Electrification will ensure capacitation of communities through irrigation systems and these will enable women to generate income. For us when we empower communities especially women we have actually empowered the nation. “Also there is the issue of health care. Once rural communities have clinics which have electricity women are able to deliver safely and this reduces infant mortality.”
