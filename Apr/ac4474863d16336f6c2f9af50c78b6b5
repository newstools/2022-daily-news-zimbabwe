BULAWAYO has recorded a significant increase in Covid-19 vaccination following a successful commencement of the schools programme.  Speaking to Daily News On Sunday yesterday, Bulawayo Provincial Medical director Maphios Siamuchembu said nearly 19 000 people had been vaccinated last week, a significant increase from 4 000 vaccinations recorded in the previous week. “We vaccinated over 18 000 people in the last seven days alone in Bulawayo. I am impressed by the uptake so far,” he said. “As of 30 March 2022, the provincial cumulative number of Covid-19 cases stood at 20 629 with 19 710 recoveries and 860 deaths. The recovery rate was 96 percent, with 59 active cases recorded.”   Generally, the overall number of provincial cases increased during the week under review, with 35 new cases recorded, compared to 30 new cases the previous week. This represents a 17 percent increase. An average of five new cases was reported per day, compared to four new cases per day the previous week. “The total number of people that received the first and second doses of Covid-19 vaccines during the week under review was 18 994 and 1 049 respectively.  “The number of people who received the first and second dose of Covid-19 vaccine increased during the week under review compared to the number (4 919 and 396 respectively) in the previous week,” Siamuchembu said.  “The overall provincial coverage for the first dose was at 57.8 percent and second dose was at 46.8 percent during the week under review.” He commended communities for supporting the schools vaccination drive, which he said had yielded results beyond set targets.   “Our campaign targeting the 12 to 15-year-olds is in progress and the uptake in the schools is good. We commend the parents for supporting this cause in the interest of public health.”
