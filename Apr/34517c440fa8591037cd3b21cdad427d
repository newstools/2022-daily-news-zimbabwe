AFTER successfully hosting Zimdancehall star Kinna’s birthday bash last weekend, veteran promoter Partson “Chipaz” Chimbodza has set up another high profile Zimdancehall event to honour the late Soul Jah Love. The concert in honour of the late Soul Jah Love is set to take place in the capital in August this year. “The idea to host a concert for Soul Jah Love came from the good relationship I had with him. We are still in the planning phase but the venue and exact line-up of performers will be decided by his fans as he was a man of the people,” Chimbodza said. The Pamamonya Ipapo hit maker died last year at the age of 31 after battling diabetes. He was declared a liberation war hero and he was interred at Warren Hills Cemetery in Harare. The forthcoming commemorative concert won’t come as a surprise to those familiar with the Zimdancehall scene. In 2014, Chipaz organised one of the most talked about Zimdancehall clashes in the country pitting the late artiste and Seh Calaz. Dubbed Sting, the event degenerated into violence as the two artistes clashed on stage. The fracas sucked in fans, prompting the police to throw teargas into the five thousand-strong crowd. As a result, there was a stampede which saw at least 10 people sustaining serious injuries. Way after the feisty clash, Chipaz, who had a well-known relationship with the late Soul Jah Love, went on to buy a BMW car for the enigmatic artiste on his birthday. The car is reportedly still parked at Chipaz’s garage in Southerton in Harare. Soul Jah Love, who was singled out by the late Oliver Mtukudzi as one of the most talented young musicians in the country, ventured into music in 2002 with his debut music project recorded in 2014. He churned out a glut of hits such as Pamamonya Ipapo, Ndini Uya Uya, Dai Hupenyu Hwaitengwa, Ndongosimudza Musoro (Gumkum) and  Kana Ndafa, among others.
