A HARARE man accused of stealing US$32 000 and jewellery worth US$152 000 from sports manager and socialite Luminitsa’s house had his freedom bid foiled after the court ordered him to stand trial on May 5. Kundai Muradzikwa is assumed to have chased Luminitsa’s maid away after a dispute over rentals and bills before gaining entry into her house and allegedly taking the money and wares. The trial was supposed to open yesterday but could not proceed with his lawyer saying they had not been served with the State papers. His lawyer went on to apply for refusal of further remand saying the court could proceed by way of summons when it was ready to proceed with the matter. The State, represented by Marian Furidze, however, applied for a postponement of the matter saying the trial prosecutor was not available after a medical emergency and applied that the matter be deferred to May 5. Harare magistrate Shane Kubonera dismissed Muradzikwa’s application saying he had not given the State a notice that he would make such an application and that the postponement now serves as the notice. When Muradzikwa initially appeared in court in October last year, he was charged with unlawful entry in aggravating circumstances. It is alleged that Muradzikwa grabbed keys from Luminitsa’s maid and ordered her to leave the house saying her boss was not paying rent and electricity bills. Allegations are that Muradzikwa exploited their absence and allegedly entered the house and stole US$32 000 cash, two watches and jewellery worth US$152 000. The State further alleges that he was in possession of the keys when the money disappeared and that he even took photographs while in her bedroom.
