FINANCE minister Mthuli Ncube has extended to December the suspension of duty on public service buses importation by Zupco to ease the country’s transport challenges. This comes as the government has also increased the number of buses Zupco can import on free duty from 250 to 500 buses per year to improve urban transport following a ban on unregistered commuter omnibuses. In a notice in the Government Gazette last week, Ncube, following consultations with the minister of Local Government July Moyo, said they agreed that the public service buses that enjoy the rebate must have a sitting capacity of at least 60 passengers. “Zupco as an approved importer shall, for a period of 12 months with effect from 1st January, 2022, be allowed to import a maximum of 500 public service buses under suspension of duty as provided for in this section.  “The approved importer shall, when effecting entry on importation, or on removal from bond of a public service bus under suspension, submit with the relevant bill of entry a declaration signed by him or her, to the effect that the public service bus is to be used for transporting persons in line with the approved importer’s public transportation business,” Ncube said. Ncube further said that a public service bus shall be admitted under suspension of duty only if the approved importer has been furnished to the satisfaction of the commissioner.  “A written authority from the Local Government ministry indicating the make, model, engine number and chassis number of the public transport service bus being imported and a valid tax clearance certificate and proof of registration in terms of the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority Act.” By Melisa Chatikobo
