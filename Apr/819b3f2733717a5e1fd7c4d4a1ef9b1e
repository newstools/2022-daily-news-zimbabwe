OWNERS of Chicken Slice, Pizza Slice, Creamy Slice and Slice Grill are targeting to expand their business into the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) region. This comes after the food chain opened its 16th branch in Braeside, Harare, last week.  The company is now set to open a new brand called Slice Feed. Speaking during the Braeside branch opening ceremony, executive chairperon of Slice Distributors Tawanda Mutyebere said the company IS targeting to open more branches in the country and in the region.  “We are expecting to open 15 more branches across Zimbabwe.  Everything is in position and it is a matter of opening.  “We are making inroads into our neighbouring countries with expectations to open branches in Zambia.  We will also be assessing business in Botswana and Mozambique,” Mutyebere said. “What we believe in as a brand is about our service and products and we value those two. When you get into any Chicken Slice branch you will see the same services that you receive in Mvuma and if you go to Masvingo, you will receive the same service.  “We believe in quality and we are not worried about prices because you must give the correct tag on our prices.  “Although we are facing some challenges like any other operating business in the country we are soldering on and hoping that the economy will improve.” Director of Slice Distributors Patricia Murambinda said the fast foods business is contributing to the growth of the economy. “We remain resolute in developing the fast food industry in the country and in Africa and we are offering our employees an opportunity to showcase their skills and talent,” she said.
