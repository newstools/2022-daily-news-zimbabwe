Nyabinde is now partially-blind and has since taken a back seat off music.  He is currently under the care of his son Agga, an heir apparent to his father’s music throne. “I spent much of my time drinking fizzy drinks which are not good for my health. Back then, I rarely went for medical check-ups or followed health tips to keep my body fit but now I do not wish to see my fellow artistes going the same route.  “They should engage health practitioners for check-ups time and again,” the Chabuda Hapana hit maker said. Recently, the social media was awash with news that he was no more. “Social media lies are slipping out more than we are realizing one should fact check and get solid evidence before calling out, social media should not be playing around with someone’s feelings especially when it is a matter of life and death.’’ Bob Nyabinde is known for his hit song Chabuda Hapana which he released in the year 2002. Last month, the government celebrated Nyabinde’s 67th birthday through a bash held at The Lit in Kwekwe. Themed “Bob Nyabinde at 67 Celebrating the Life of an Icon,” the event “Bob @ 67 Birthday Bash” saw different musicians sharing the stage, among them Tongai Moyo Jnr, Suluman Chimbetu, Ammi Jamanda, Samukoko, The Groove, Guruve Marimba Ensemble and Agga Nyabinde.
