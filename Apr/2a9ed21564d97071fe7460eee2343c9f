PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa yesterday sacked Frank Muchengwa as commissioner of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission following recommendations of a tribunal set up to investigate allegations of graft against him. The tribunal, appointed in October 2020 and chaired by retired Justice Nicholas Ndou, was tasked to investigate whether Muchengwa interfered with the course of justice during the course of his duties, whether he interfered with investigations, received bribes and passed on confidential information concerning matters that he was investigating, and whether he presided over matters in which he had an interest. Its other members included Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs ministry permanent secretary Virginia Mabhiza, Tarisai Mutangi and Tecla Mapota. Speaking to journalists after the handing over of the report at State House, Harare, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services ministry permanent secretary Nick Mangwana said Mnangagwa had upheld the recommendations of the tribunal. “The tribunal has reported its findings to His Excellency, the president… and has recommended that Commissioner Frank Muchengwa be removed from office for acts of gross misconduct. “Accordingly, His Excellency the President, acting in terms… the Constitution, has removed Commissioner Frank Muchengwa from office with immediate effect,” Mangwana said. The Constitution provides that a member of an independent commission may be removed from office only on the grounds that he has been found guilty of gross misconduct. The tribunal, which was initially given five months to complete its work, had its tenure extended by six months last September to March this year and by a further one month last month. —  New Ziana
