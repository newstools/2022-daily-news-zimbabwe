HEALTH experts have called upon the government to increase the number of Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid and Camera (VIAC) centres in the country in order to diagnose cancer early. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Cancer Care Network Zimbabwe oncologist Nomsa Tsikai said rural communities were facing challenges by having to travel long distances to get screened for cancer at Parirenyatwa, Mpilo, Harare hospitals, among others. “Some of the people cannot afford to travel long distances due to lack of funds and if the government decentralises VIAC centres in all the provinces it helps easier access to getting tested earlier. “We are facing challenges because people are being diagnosed with cancer at a late stage due to failure to get screened. “The large number of people living with HIV results in an even higher number of people who will develop cancer in Zimbabwe. “There is a need for the government to conduct an awareness campaign in the country in order for people to get tested early because it helps to reduce deaths due to advanced cancer cases,” Tsikai said. She said Cancer Care Network Zimbabwe was also advocating for cheaper treatment for cancer patients as most people cannot afford chemotherapy. Tsikai also bemoaned the fact that most radiotherapy machines in the country were dysfunctional Cancer Care Network clinical officer Abigirl Dahwa said cancer cases in Zimbabwe were increasing and that the disease was one of the major public health concerns in sub-Saharan Africa. “Zimbabwe diagnoses 7 000 cancer cases per year and it records over 1 500 deaths. I encourage people to exercise since it helps to boost the system, thereby reducing the possibility of getting infected by cancer. “In Zimbabwe most of the people are affected by prostate, breast and cervical cancer that can be treated if detected early. “People need to get screened regularly because it helps in the fight against the disease to reduce deaths,” Dahwa said.
