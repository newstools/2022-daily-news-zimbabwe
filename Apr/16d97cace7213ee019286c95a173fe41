DOMESTIC and global developments, including the Russia-Ukraine war which has triggered product shortages and price hikes in many countries, will be up for discussion in Harare next week when the Daily News hosts one of its popular breakfast forums. The event, to be held on April 14, will provide a perfect platform for key government officials, captains of industry and the business community at large to interface on challenges gripping the domestic economy. The Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ) — publishers of the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday — which is hosting the crucial indaba, is confident that the event will provide the business community the opportunity to get clarifications from the government in the face of the pressure on the Zimbabwean economy from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, currency instability and rising inflation.  “With the war showing no sign of ending, the local business community is understandably keen to know the measures the government intends to put in place to cushion Zimbabweans,” ANZ commercial director Lewis Chikurunhe said. He described the imminent event, expected to be attended by at least 150 people, as a ‘‘must-attend’’ for all business leaders seeking solutions to lead their businesses profitably in a very challenging environment. “This is going to be a crucial meeting. It is about giving practical solutions to those in the public sector so that they are better prepared to confront issues blighting our economy,” Chikurunhe added. The News Business Breakfast Forum is an interactive platform for business and policymakers that the country’s leading daily newspaper brand has hosted over the past couple of years as part of its contribution to the development of the country. More details on this crucial event will be available in the course of the week.
