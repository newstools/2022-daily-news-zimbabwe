A HARARE woman found herself in trouble after she was allegedly found with 52 crocodile skins without a permit.  Vimbai Dzingirai, 31, was charged for contravening a section of the Parks and Wildlife act for allegedly possessing the trophies without a permit.  Allegations are that on March 24 detectives from CID Minerals Flora and Fauna Unit, Harare, received information that Dzingirai was in possession of crocodile skins without a permit. A team of detectives reportedly went to number 11, 18th Avenue, Mabelreign, where they saw her and revealed the purpose of their visit.  Allegations are that detectives asked to search her house which she agreed to and they recovered 52 crocodile skins which were in her kitchen.   She was asked to produce a permit authorising her to be in possession of the crocodile trophies and she reportedly said it was in Masvingo.  Detectives reportedly took the crocodile skins and took them to the station pending availing of the said permit. Meanwhile, police in Chiredzi arrested one Godfrey Chiremba for being in possession of a python carcass. “On April 1, Police in Chiredzi arrested Godfrey Chiremba (48) for possession of specially protected animals.
