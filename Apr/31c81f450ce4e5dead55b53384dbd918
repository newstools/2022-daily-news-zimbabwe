ONE person died while two others were injured in a shootout with the police after a foiled armed robbery attempt that led to the arrest of two people, including a soldier. Thulani Maphosa, the soldier, together with Michael Khanyiso Moyo, a South African resident, were in court yesterday facing allegations of attempted robbery and unlawful possession of firearms. They were remanded in custody until April 26 when they appeared before Harare magistrate Yeukai Dzuda. Their alleged accomplices Dalubuhle Ndlovu and Precious Dube were slapped with the same charges while admitted in hospital after sustaining injuries in the shooting.  It is alleged that on March 30 detectives picked up information that the four together with the deceased Meluleki Makhalima and two others who are at large were on their way to rob a house in Greendale. Detectives reacted swiftly and waylaid the suspects at the said address. At around 2230 hours, the suspects allegedly got to the house and attempted to scale over the precast wall, but they were interrupted by barking dogs. Neighbours were alerted and managed to arrest Maphosa while his other colleagues managed to escape while driving in two getaway cars, including a VW Golf 6 with South African registration plates and Toyota Corolla. Reports are that the detectives chased after the suspects and confronted them at a fuel station near the Harare show grounds. It is alleged that the suspects opened fire targeting the detectives, who also returned fire, resulting in other suspects being injured while two others escaped with the VW Golf 6. Their arrest led to the recovery of two pistols and six rounds of ammunition. The State alleges that none of them is a holder of a firearm certificate in respect of the recovered firearms and ammunition.
