CONTROVERSIAL Zimdancehall artiste Seh Calaz, pictured, is set to re-launch his latest studio album Bvopfiro Pariro as a way of giving it a new market life. The launch is set for April 30 in the capital and organisers have blamed effects of Covid-19 for the poor performance of the album. “We launched it on social media and we have realised that we have short-changed our ghetto youths who have no access to data (airtime); so we saw it prudent to give them the product as they are used to,” one of the organisers of the event Partson “Chipaz” Chimbodza said. The latest album released last year is made up of 10 new tracks: Shandawani, Ndofira Ipapo, It’s Okay It’s Okay, Kana Tauya, Ndagara Ndodhakwa, Bherengende, Murisei Madinga, Bvopfiro Pariro, Ma1 Aya, Kanye West and a bonus track Hwahwa (Amapiano Refix). The veteran music promoter admitted that Zimdancehall is for the young. “Zimdancehall is not a social media genre. Most of its fans are not that active on social media due to financial reasons. Hence we cannot rely on digital platforms to promote the genre,” he said. Popular for his signature chant Check Check Check, Seh Calaz rose to stardom with songs such as Mabhanditi, Mumota Murikubvira and Kwatinobva Kwakasiyana Siyana among others. Some of his previous albums include Bhanditi Rebirth, Jamba Ngoma, Bholato Bholato, Seh Calaz Original, Ndaqatumwa, Seh Calaz @30 and Ghetto D.N.A to name just a few. Last week, Seh Calaz real name Tawanda Mumanyi, delivered a polished act at Kinnah’s birthday bash held at the Harare Gardens. The high profile Zimdancehall gigs being lined up come at a time when many critics were claiming that the once popular genre died with Soul Jah Love.
