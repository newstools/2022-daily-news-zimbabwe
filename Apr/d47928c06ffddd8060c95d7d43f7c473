THE case in which Vice President Constantino Chiwenga’s ex-wife, Marry  is accused of attempted murder is now ready for trial, the State has said. Marry was in court yesterday where cases in which she is accused of money laundering and attempted murder were pushed to June 1. The State said the docket for attempted murder is now complete and on June 1 she would be advised of the trial date. Her lawyer Doug Coltart, appearing on behalf Beatrice Mtetwa, gave the State notice that they will be applying for refusal of further remand if they are not given a trial date on the day. Allegations are that she unlawfully removed Chiwenga’s medical intravenous set as well as the central venous catheter that he had as he was battling for life at a South African hospital, causing excessive bleeding. Allegations are that she also forced him off the bed, held his hand, and moved him out of the ward and only to be intercepted by the security personnel. Allegations of money laundering involve US$900 000. Marry has since been convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $60 000 in a case she was accused of misrepresenting that Chiwenga wanted to wed at a time he was bed ridden. It was proved that in July 2019, Marry made a false representation to then Judge President of the High Court George Mutandwa Chiweshe that Chiwenga had consented to wed under the Marriage Act at their place of residence in Borrowdale Brooke, Harare. She is currently standing trial on a case she is alleged to have assaulted their maid Delight Munyoro at a school in the capital. She has denied the allegations saying they are an attempt by her former husband to use close people to alienate her from their children saying her hands were too swollen and painful to slap anyone.
