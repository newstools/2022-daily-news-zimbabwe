Manica Diamonds  ……………. 0 Bulawayo Chiefs …..…………. 0 BULAWAYO Chiefs coach Nilton Terroso was left to rue chances missed by his team as they failed to find the target against Manica Diamonds at Sakubva Stadium yesterday. Chiefs had ample opportunities to arrest the rot that has seen them fail to win their last seven matches. From the start Chiefs looked like a team trying to win the match but their forwards Perfect Chikwende, Aurther Musiiwa, Billy Verumu and Mthokozisi Msebe let them down after taking turns to miss good scoring opportunities. “We were the better team in the second half, we played more in their half, unfortunately for us and just like in the previous matches, we failed to utilise our chances,” Terroso said after the match. “It’s frustrating missing those chances because we know if we score one of them, we are more than likely to win the game. “I’m not really concerned because the important thing is that we are creating those chances. We are able to get into the final third; we are doing the right things but the problem is finishing.” The draw took Chiefs’ tally to 11 points after 11 matches. Manica Diamonds coach Johannes Nhumwa admitted his charges had a bad day in the office. “We were not determined. We were rushing our efforts at the end of the day we drew. We can talk of a point but we were playing at home, we should be picking maximum points,”  Nhumwa said.
