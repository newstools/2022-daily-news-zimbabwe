WINKY D justified why he is called “The Big Man” with a scintillating performance at the Dope Party first anniversary held at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) on Saturday night. Also known as Gafa, Winky D, born Wallace Chirumiko, delivered an hour-long performance packed with many of his hits.  He kept his fans busy on the dance floor with hits such as Njema and Panorwadza Moyo. But it was his latest songs Happy Again and Reply that animated the sparsely packed HICC. At the height of his performance, some fans found it hard to hold back their joy and could be seen flinging wads of the greenback into the air in appreciation of Winky D’s act. Not even the audio glitches that affected part of Winky D’s performance dampen the electric mood in the giant HICC. The Happy Again hit-maker shared the stage with, among other artistes, the equally impressive  visiting South African musician Focalistic. The highlight of Focalistic’s act was the performance of the hit Ke Star which also attracted some wads of cash from the appreciative crowd. As expected, rising musician Enzo Ishall delivered a memorable act on the night, with the crowd falling in love with his timeless hits such as Urikutsvireiko. Other impressive acts on the night included Buffalo Souljah, Killer T, King 98 and Sandra Ndebele. South Africa-based award winning reggae artiste Buffalo Souljah was particularly impressive as he performed hits such as Rugare and Munamato, among others. Zim hip-hop star Stunner also used the concert to remind those in attendance that he still remains a force to reckon with.  He performed  a number of hits such as Panext Door. by  Ashley Moyo ENTERTAINMENT WRITER moyoa@dailynews.co.zw
