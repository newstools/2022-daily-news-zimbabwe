ZIMDANCEHALL heavyweight Winky D and sungura ace Alick Macheso are the headliners at this year’s edition of Castle Tankard. The two musicians, who will be supported by equally-talented musician Enzo Ishall on May 7 at Borrowdale Racecourse in the capital, are currently in the United Kingdom for the annual Sama Festival which kicked off yesterday. Over the years, Winky D has been an integral part of the annual event and his manager Jonathan Banda attributed the consistency to high levels of professionalism exuded by the Vigilance Family, Winky D’s backing group. “We have been a regular feature at Castle Tankard events since 2010 save for last year.  “We missed the 2014 edition of the annual event because we had a musical concert in South Africa. “Of late, the corporate side fell in love with Winky D owing to his high levels of professionalism, he is one of the few artists that can really give value for money,” said Banda. The event was affected last year by the Covid-19 pandemic. Winky D, whose albums include Gafa Life, Gombwe and The People’s Devotee among others, has participated at various Delta Beverages functions such as Beer Festivals and Campus Nights just to mention a few. Since the launch of his musical career, the Happy Again singer has performed in almost every continent and he boasts a number of musical accolades. He won the National Arts Merit Awards with albums Igofigo, Gafa Futi and People’s Choice award in 2010, 2015, 2016 and 2020. The Ninja President, as Winky D is affectionately known by his fans, shared the stage with international musicians such as P-Square, Capleton and Beenie Man to name but a few.
