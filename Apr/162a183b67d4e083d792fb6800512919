MENTAL health advocates say they are confident that through awareness campaigns and expos they will rope in the corporate world   to fight against mental health.  Some of the 2022 mental health sponsors were ZB bank and 3Ktv. Speaking on the side-lines of the 2022 mental health expo in Harare yesterday, Young people mental health president Tawanda Murepa said the presence of business showed the greenlight to the fight against mental health, drug and substance abuse in the country. “We are pleased with the presence of big businesses like ZB bank, Nyaradzo, National Aids Council (NAC) among other exhibitors…we hope that after this expo, if we approach any of the companies which exhibited today asking for partnership or funds we will get positive responses,” said Murepa  Actress Kessia Masona (Muchaneta) said  just like physical health no one is immune to mental health. “Today’s event  is open to everyone  from sports, entertainment and business people among all invited guests…we want to spread the word of awareness about mental health so that we create a sense of restoration to those who are at the verge of  giving up,” said Masona.
