TWO suspected robbers have been nabbed for allegedly conniving with a High Court prosecutor to be granted bail using forged papers.  Evidence Tawanda Masawi allegedly had his papers altered to rape while those of one Office Chanakira were altered to attempted murder from robbery and they were granted bail at the High Court.  The two were charged for allegedly defeating the course of justice.  Allegations are that Masawi was arrested for a case of robbery and was remanded in custody after his bail bid failed at Chitungwiza magistrate’s court.  It is alleged that while he was at Harare Remand Prison, he hatched a plan to seek freedom through illicit means. He allegedly connived with Henry Muringani, a High Court public prosecutor, to amend the state papers and forged a lesser charge of rape for him to be granted bail.  The forged papers were filed with the Registrar of High court under bail number B110/22. Claims are that the misrepresentation led to Masawi being admitted to bail. Another suspect, Chanakira was also arrested for robbery. He was also remanded in custody and allegedly connived with Muringani and had his papers amended to a lesser charge of attempted murder for him to be granted bail.  The alleged forged papers were filed with the Registrar of High court under bail number B111/22. As a result of this misrepresentation, Chanakira was granted bail. Meanwhile, Muringani is still in custody on five counts of obstruction of justice and he will be back in court for bail application.
