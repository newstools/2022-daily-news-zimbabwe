THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) has warned members of the public to be on the lookout for fraudsters who are posing as its officials. In a statement yesterday, Zimra public relations manager Francis Chimanda said the fraudsters were masquerading as tax auditors using D. Musakwa, B. Masango,  Chibungu,  Kunaka and Chikodzonge’s names. “These individuals have been reported as sending SMSs and have been calling tax payers announcing intention to conduct an audit and subsequently soliciting for bribes to avoid carrying out the audit or affecting the results on the intended audit,”Chimanda said. “Clients are encouraged to be aware that Zimra is not associated with and has no links with the bogus auditors and our workers have clearly defined work procedures and do not carry out Zimara business over unofficial personal media platforms such SMS, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook. “Zimra employees carry with them valid staff identity cards when on duty and do not ask for any form of monetary deposits into their personal bank accounts for them to conduct Zimra business and customers should not be intimidated into unnecessary parting with their money through actions of the bogus Zimra employees”. The tax collector urged members of the public to report to the nearest police station and nearest Zimra offices when approached by fraudsters.
