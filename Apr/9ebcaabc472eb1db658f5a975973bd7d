Andile Tshuma in BULAWAYO BULAWAYO City Council (BCC) says it is on cloud nine after being accorded the honours to host one of the country’s revered annual days, the Independence. The city has been abuzz with activity as council and government departments were yesterday putting in final touches to the preparations for the big day whose main activities will be held at Barbourfields Stadium today. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Bulawayo corporate affairs manager Nesisa Mpofu said the city had managed to spruce up its image.  “The city of Bulawayo is very honoured to be hosting the 42nd independence celebrations and  we made efforts to titivate the city. We are ready as we have seen our various services through departments. We are working with different state communities to host such an August event,” she said. “The city of Bulawayo is now ready to host the celebrations. We have been working on various aspects to prepare. The city has been working on road rehabilitation and pothole patching on major roads that are key for the Independence Celebrations, grass cutting and clearing shoulders and medians. This was done through community groups,” she said. She called on shop owners to complement council efforts in keeping the second largest city clean. “The city is also calling on shop owners to remove unsightly and defaced advertising signs outside their buildings particularly for historic buildings. We have also been clearing sanitary lanes and dumps of litter and are requesting members of the public to desist from littering and dumping waste. We continue to attend to water and sewer bursts,” said Mpofu. “The stadium was also refurbished with some decorative accessories being installed,” she added. This year’s national independence celebrations are being held in the City of Kings for the first time since 1980 as President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration thrives to ensure devolution of power becomes a reality.
