IDEAS Party leader Herbert Chamuka has urged President Emmerson Mnangagwa to urgently meet his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa over increasing reports of violence against foreign nationals. He said his party was concerned about the increase in xenophobic attacks against Zimbabweans hence the need for the head of state to reach a consensus as the two nations enjoy cordial relations. Speaking on the death of a Zimbabwean national Elvis Nyathi who was killed in a recent xenophobic attack, Chamuka said a meeting between Mnangagwa and Ramaphosa would help ease the tension that has resulted in foreign nationals being targeted for attack by South Africans. “I am calling for an emergency meeting between Cyril Ramaphosa and Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree on a mutual plan on how to co-exist as neighbouring countries  “Countries such as Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, Namibia, South Africa, Malawi are neighbours who should be working together in times of war and drought among other regional problems,” said Chamuka. “But it’s showing as if South Africa wants to be independent which doesn’t want to contribute ideas towards solving problems in other Southern African countries,” added Chamuka. He said he felt South Africa was insincere on Nyathi’s death saying it’s statements on the issue showed lack of genuine care for the safety of foreigners living and working in their country. “South African government is not sincere, its behaving like a crocodile which mourns its prey, Cyril Ramaphosa as a leader of South Africa is the main problem because he seems to be supporting those perpetrating xenophia,” added Chamuka. He said the dudula leader who is leading onslaught against foreigners, is a rebel in the league of the late Islamic rebel leader Osama Bin Laden.
