LOCAL Government minister July Moyo, pictured, yesterday said commuter omnibuses (kombis) are not coming back despite transport woes that are affecting many urbanites.  Speaking to the Daily News, Moyo reiterated that only Zupco buses or those who joined the Zupco franchise are allowed to ferry passengers “Private Kombis are not coming back, the position remains forever. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is working very hard to purchase Zupco buses   which will be enough to cater for the commuting public,” Moyo said. This comes after police warned the commuting public not to board mushikashika transport as they risk being robbed or killed. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) reiterates that members of the public must avoid boarding mushikashika vehicles or use their private vehicles as pirate taxis as they risk falling prey to robbers,” the police said in a statement at the weekend. Zimbabwe Passengers Association president   Tafadzwa Goriyati said passengers were facing a transport crisis as Zupco was ending their evening operations earlier than expected. ‘We were promised that there are new buses coming on-board, but we are not seeing them…We have not seen any change on the demand and supply …  we are seeing unready worthy vehicles, risking lives of the  commuters,” Goriyati said. He also noted that the commuting public have resorted to open trucks and mushikashika because of desperation. “In the evening, passengers are boarding anything which comes on the road because of shortage of Zupco transport… people are being robbed of their possessions because of transport desperation,” he said  In an interview with the Daily News, Paidamoyo Chirere who resides in Budiriro said their area is serviced by one Zupco bus. “If you miss that bus, you will have to wait for another trip… commuting to town is very hard and expensive because you hike from here and you pay US$1 to the roundabout and board another car to town,” she said.
