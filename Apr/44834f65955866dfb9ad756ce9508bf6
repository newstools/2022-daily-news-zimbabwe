A HARARE man has been nabbed for allegedly trying to kill his wife amid accusations that he poured acid on her, which caused her serious burns. Tatenda Pasipamire, 34, was not asked to plead to attempted murder charges when he appeared before a Harare magistrate who remanded him in custody to April 21, and was advised to apply for bail at the High Court. In another incident Zvikomborero Karichi found herself in trouble for allegedly assaulting her three-year-old niece for soiling herself. It is alleged that the minor was taking a bath when she relieved herself in the water, which did not go down well with Karichi who allegedly took a rope and whipped her. She is further alleged to have poured hot water in a dish saying she wanted to bath her. The child got into the water resulting in her sustaining burns on her feet. Karichi reportedly took the child back to her mother in Mutoko who discovered the burns. She further examined her body and saw bruises and took her to hospital where she was admitted. A report was made and Karichi was arrested and charged with attempted murder. She was remanded in custody until April 28. In another incident, a teenage step-mother was remanded in custody over allegations of ill-treating a two-year-old boy. Meloy Shonhiwa is alleged to have assaulted the boy several times on his buttocks and privates leaving him in pain. Reports are that an informant noticed the child had swollen privates and took him to the police where a case was opened. Shonhiwa was remanded  in custody to Tuesday to allow her husband to bring a birth certificate to ascertain her age as she stated she is 17.
