Rutendo Ngara ngarar@dailynews.co.zw THE government has suspended all civil registration fees to allow everyone to access national identity cards and birth and death certificates as well as livestock branding certificates. This comes as the government is currently on a mobile registration blitz which will end on September 30, 2022 and is targeting the issuance of at least two million IDs and birth certificates. In a statement yesterday, Home Affairs minister Kazembe Kazembe said authorities were working with the mantra, “no one should be left behind” in order to clear a backlog created by the Covid-19 lockdowns over the years.
