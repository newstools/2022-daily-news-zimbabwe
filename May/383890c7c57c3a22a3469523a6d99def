SUNGURA music giant Alick Macheso is stepping up preparations for the release of his 10th album set for June 10 at Aquatic Complex and is taking time off the stage as he finalises the project. The singer who just returned from Botswana will tonight hold a welcome back gig at Werras Park in Glen View 1. Tomorrow he will be at the Borrowdale Race Course for the Castle Tankard together with Winky D and Enzo Ishall. He will complete the weekend with a gig at Jongwe Corner Chinhoyi. These will mark his last public gigs before the album launch save for corporate events, making them must attend for his fans.
