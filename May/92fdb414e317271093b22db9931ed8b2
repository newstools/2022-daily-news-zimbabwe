VETERAN musician and poet Albert Nyathi, pictured,  has been re-elected the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) board chairperson. This comes as the association of composers and publishers of music which was formed in 1982 to protect their rights under the copyright law, held its Annual General Meeting a fortnight ago in Harare where new board members were elected to move the organisation forward. Sungura musician First Farai is the association’s new vice chairperson. “Rapper Mudiwa Hood, who is a banker and senior manager at a local bank, got the secretary general post and is also the director of Innovation and Strategy whose main role is to find ways of generating more revenue for the organisation,” Alexio Gwenzi, the board’s Information and Publicity director said. Popular gospel musician Janet Manyowa, a qualified chartered accountant, retained the treasurer post while Philip Chifumbu an afro-fusion artist, was given the Events and Planning portfolio.   Deputy Minister of ICT, Postal and Courier Services, Dingumuzi Phuti, who was appointed to the board by the Zimura council, will be responsible for Relationship Management and Liaison. “The new positions were created in order to increase effectiveness of the board as the association seeks to transform itself.  “We can say this is a transformational board, and the coming in of young blood such as Gwenzi, Manyowa and Hood into the board will see the organisation transforming into a world class Collective Management Organisation,” Gwenzi said. Witness Zhangazha continues with his role as the association’s legal advisor in the board, while Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, who is the executive director of Zimura remains as Ex Officio member of the board, doubling up as the board secretary.
