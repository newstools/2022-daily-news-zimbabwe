We want to make the mbira music composers understand more about the organisation and its functions including their rights provided for in the Copyright Act,” Zimura executive director, Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, said.   The mbira workshop is part of Zimura’s 40th anniversary celebrations. “As we are celebrating 40 years of existence, we have lined up a number of activities to celebrate the milestone and these include provincial workshops and concerts among others all meant to raise copyright act awareness. For the mbira workshop, we have realised that it’s more effective doing workshops targeting different genres at a time.” The Mbira instrument is a heritage for the Shonas and it was popularised overseas by the likes of Dumisani Maraire, Stella Chiweshe, Nyamasvisva and Maungira Enharira among others.
