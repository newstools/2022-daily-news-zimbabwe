POLICE in Bulawayo are investigating a case of fraud in which a man was defrauded of US$7 701 by suspected two female illegal money changers. Bulawayo police spokesperson Abednico Ncube yesterday told the Daily News that the complainant is a male adult aged 32 years from Bellevue suburb. “On the February 1, 2022 at around 10am,  the accused persons went to the complainant’s premises and asked  for small denominations of hard cash in exchange of US$10 000. “The accused persons counted an amount of 80xUS$100 notes and gave it to the complainant who then in return gave them an amount of US$8 000 in small amounts. After the accused had left, the complainant then realised that he had been given 99 xUS$1 notes covered by two US$100 notes.   “The complainant reported the matter to the police around 12.30pm and no arrests were made. The total value defrauded is US$7 701 and nothing was recovered. Investigations are still in progress,” Ncube said. He urged the public never to trust anyone and to make sure they verify any business transaction before involving themselves in any deal. “We also want to appeal to anyone with information which can lead to the arrest of the accused persons to report at any nearest police station,” Ncube said. by  Hazel Marimbiza In BULAWAYO
