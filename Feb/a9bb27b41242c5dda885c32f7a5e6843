A DRIVER employed by a local bakery, Gram Kandeya, who allegedly raped an 18-year-old girl after he offered her a lift, yesterday denied the allegations during trial. Kandeya claimed that the girl had consented to sex and that they were “lovebirds”. Allegations are that on July 31 last year, the complainant was coming from Mbare Musika, Harare, where she had gone to buy airtime for resale. When she reached George Secondary School in Mbare, the accused person, who was driving a bread delivery truck, offered her transport to Waterfalls and the girl agreed.   Allegations are that Kandeya told the lady that he had to pass through his workplace at a local bakery first and would later drop her home. Kandeya reportedly picked up his co-workers and dropped them off along the way and there were only the two of them left. The court heard that at around 6pm, Kandeya allegedly diverted the route and drove to Whitehouse Shopping Centre. The lady reportedly told the accused that she wanted to go home, but the accused allegedly insisted he wanted to buy fresh chips for her before he could drop the girl off. The suspect reportedly bought the chips and the duo started eating together until it was dark. The State alleges Kandeya locked the doors and proposed love to the girl who reportedly turned him down. But the negative response allegedly did not go down well with Kandeya who reportedly forced her on the girl. After the offence, the State alleges that the driver promised to marry the complainant, apologising for deflowering her. Kandeya allegedly took the girl home at around 4am where she went on to confide in her mother who accompanied her to make a police report.
