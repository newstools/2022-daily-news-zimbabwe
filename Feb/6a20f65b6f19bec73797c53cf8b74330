ZVISHAVANE Town Council has bowed to pressure from residents to renovate the derelict Majaradha communal toilets which have over the years been a subject of health hazards in Mandava high density suburb. This comes after Zvishavane Residents Association chairperson, Kamino Simango wrote to Midlands Provincial Affairs minister, Larry Mavima requesting him to intervene on the situation that had resulted in at least over 100 people sharing a single toilet. Speaking to the Daily News on Sunday in an interview yesterday, council acting secretary, Ongororo Mazai said following the pressure from residents, council had engaged a contractor to start renovating the toilets. “We have engaged a contractor to work on the toilets that have been in a sorry state posing danger to residents who were at the risk of contracting diseases like cholera because of the unhygienic state.   ‘‘Residents have been approaching the council about it and recently they even engaged higher authorities,” Mazai said, adding that the renovation was being done in phases. “We are done with toilet number one and we move to other toilets. We have painted and put a new floor and also made it conducive for people living with disabilities,” he said. But residents’ chairperson Simango said while they appreciated efforts by council, there was a need to also build more toilets to suit the population demands. “I wrote to the minister (Mavima) and told him the condition of the toilets. You will find out at least 500 people are sharing a toilet which is already in a sorry state. These toilets do not have seats and have cracked floors. Of course renovating toilets is good but residents also need more new toilets to avoid congestion. “This is an urgent need because it speaks to the health and wellbeing of residents. Also to note is that there are old people staying there (at Majaradha flats) and also those living with disabilities so they really need a conducive environment,” he said.
