FUNGISAI Zvakavapano will unveil her latest project featuring South Africa gospel music sensation Winnie Mashaba today. The song titled Mufaro Washe will be available on all major digital platforms. “It was my dream to collaborate with Mashaba. I hope the song will open doors for me in South Africa and the region at large,” the Toita Zvedenga hit maker said. Mashaba is the third South African musician to collaborate with the Makomborero hit maker after Buhle and the late Lundi.   “I have also shared the stage with a number of South African musicians especially during the Nguva Yakwana Gospel concerts.” Both Fungisai and Winnie (Mashaba) have been in the music business for over two decades, with each boasting over 15 albums. Some of Fungisai’s albums include: Zvirevo, Highway, Toita Zvedenga, Chandisimudza and Healing Devotion,  among others while Winnie’s discography is made up of: Exoda 20, Bongang Lerato, Ke Rata Wena, Motswelle Se Bapale Ka Kekere and The Journey With Winnie Mashaba and all. Fungisai told the Daily News that she has now shifted her focus to Nigeria.  “I have some unfinished business with a number of Nigerian musicians. Fans should expect some interesting collaborations from me with Nigerian artistes from now onwards,” she said. In response to increasing gender-based violence cases which skyrocketed during the course of the national Covid-19 lockdown when couples spent hours together unlike before, Fungisai intends to launch three singles on the issue next month.  “I am intending to launch the singles on March 8 when the world will be celebrating the achievements of women from social, economic, cultural and political backgrounds,” she said.
