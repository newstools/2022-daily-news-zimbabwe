A ZVISHAVANE man has been banned from driving for two years after he negligently caused an accident along Gweru-Zvishavane road last month. Itai Zhangazha, 34, who is a holder of classes 2, 4 and 5 driver’s licence was banned by magistrate Archie Wochiunga when he appeared before him yesterday facing negligent driving charges. In addition to the ban, Zhangazha was also sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment or pay a $20 000 fine. It was the State’s case that Zhangazha was involved in an accident at the 94-kilometre peg on January 5, 2022 at around 0030hours, when he was driving a vehicle with a trailer towards Gweru.   “Upon reaching a curve, his trailer encroached onto the opposite lane and hit a Volkswagen vehicle which was travelling in the opposite direction. Both vehicles veered off the road,” the court heard. All the four people aboard the Volkswagen were injured and ferried to hospital and the vehicle sustained a shattered windscreen, deformed bonnet and damaged front tyre. Zhangazha was not injured. The court held Zhangazha responsible for the accident, saying he failed to keep his vehicle under control or stop to avoid a collision that seemed imminent. “The driver failed to keep proper lookout of the road under the circumstances, failed to keep his vehicle under control and failed to stop or act reasonably when the collision seemed imminent,” the court heard.
