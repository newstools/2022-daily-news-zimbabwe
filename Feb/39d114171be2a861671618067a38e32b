A HARARE family lost US$30 000 and other valuables on Sunday, to an armed robber who attacked them at their Picnic Park home in Waterfalls, Harare. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said the suspect, who was armed with an unidentified pistol, pounced at the house, where he attempted to rape the maid first before robbing the family of money and valuables. “Police in Harare are investigating a case of robbery which occurred on January 30 at Picnic Park, Waterfalls. “A suspect who was armed with an unidentified pistol pounced at the complainant’s house… before stealing US$30 000 cash, two laptops, two cellphones and a safe containing title deeds, educational certificates as well as Toyota Fortuner vehicle keys,”  Nyathi said.   Meanwhile, the police last week also arrested four bogus Criminal Investigations Department (CID) officers for robbing a Harare home on December 30, last year. Police allege that Prosper Chidaushe (35), Archiford Machona Chipfuva (30), Tendayi Leyo (32) and Amos Chibharo (32) attacked a house in Mt Pleasant, Harare, where they produced fake CID identity cards before gaining entrance to the home. They allegedly managed to get away with US$240 and a car. However, following police investigations, the four were arrested last week. “On Thursday last week the police in Harare arrested the four suspects in connection with an armed robbery case that occurred … last year. “The four suspects allegedly pounced at a house in Mt Pleasant, Harare, where they produced fake police ID’s written CID before stealing US$240 and a Toyota Allion,” Nyathi said.
